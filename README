  All Platforms
    - A working MythTV backend 0.21 or 0.22 (trunk)

Installation
================
  
  1. Extract mythbox.tar.gz to the following directory:
     Linux   : ~/.xbmc/scripts 
     Mac     : ~/Library/Application Support/XBMC/scripts
     Windows : C:\Documents and Settings\[user]\Application Data\XBMC\scripts
     Vista   : C:\Users\[user]\AppData\Roaming\XBMC\scripts
           
  2. Launch XBMC
  
  3. Select Scripts from the main menu in XBMC
  
  4. Select MythBox to execute the script
  
  5. You'll be sent straight to the Settings screen. 
     Fill in all the settings and click on the 'Test Settings'
     button until you get a 'Settings OK' message.
  
  6. Exit the Settings screen & enjoy!
  

Future plans
=============
- Complete re-write of UI to use WindowXML (skinners/gfx help needed)
- Standalone python bindings for MythTV
- MythTV RSS feeds

  
TODO
=============================
- Get rid of settings for mythbackend hostname and port. These values can be queried from the settings tables
  as MasterServerIP and MasterServerPort
- RSS feed of the latest MythTV news using RSS Feed control - http://xbmc.org/wiki/?title=Controls#Available_controls
- patch xbmc.Dialog.select(...) to support selection by index
- patch to expose ControlSlider via the python interface


History
==========================
MythBox was forked from xbmc-mythtv (http://xbmc-mythtv.sourceforge.net) 
and heavily modified to bring MythTV protocol support up to date, 
add new features, and make MythTV a pleasure to use in XBMC (obviously, not there yet).
Many thanks to all the developers whose time and effort went into the original 
xbmc-mythtv project!
